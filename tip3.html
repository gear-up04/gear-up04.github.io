            <p><strong>Engine Oil Type</strong></p>
            The last aspect to consider when choosing the right oil for your vehicle is the type of engine oil.

            It is also essential to understand the primary differences between different engine oil such as mineral oil, full and semi-synthetic oils: <br>
            <p><strong>Mineral Oils: </strong></p>
            This type of oil has a comparatively low resistance to oxidation and heat. It can sustain your vehicle for approximately 5000 kilometers without the need to change it regularly, thus saving you extra money. If your car engine is old and always uses mineral oil, it will give it additional protection and performance.
            <p><strong>Synthetic Oil</strong></p>
            Synthetic oil is modified chemically to enhance engine performance and contain very few impurities. Synthetic oils are of high quality because they have high resistance to oxidation and heat. Your car can last approximately 10000 kilometers before changing the oil. Synthetic oils enhance engine performance and prolong its life. This type of oil economies on fuel and has perfect anti-friction.<br>
